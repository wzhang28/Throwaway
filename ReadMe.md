# Throwaway GitHub Repository

This is just a place where I am learning about working with GitHub repositories.

A Markup file (.md) is a text file that uses *Markup syntax* to produce a document 
that others can read online when they check out your repository.

I hope to learn the following:

- How to make a repo
- How to publish a repo using GitHub Desktop
- How to make commits to a repo

Let's give it a go :) Also, try out [Introduction to 
GitHub](https://github.github.io/on-demand) to learn more.
